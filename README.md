# Superstore Database Normalization

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a simple database normalization. In this case, I use the superstore dataset, which is widely known. This data is very helpful for us to learn how to analyze data (e.g., Data Visualization, Importing to SQL, Python, etc.). Thanks for providing this data.
